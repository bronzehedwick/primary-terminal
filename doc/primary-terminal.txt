ABOUT                                                        *primary-terminal*

vim-primary-terminal is a dead simple terminal manager for Neovim (and
eventually Vim 8).

It provides thin conveince wrappers around core terminal functionality,
focused on managing a single terminal instance.

Basically, this plugin is proud to barely do anything.

The first time a 'terminal' is created, vim-primary-terminal identifies
it as the primary terminal, applying mappings and commands to quickly
switch to and send input to that buffer. This primary designation
persists until the buffer is destroyed; after that, the next 'terminal'
created becomes the primary terminal.

Commands and mappings that manage the primary terminal will create a new
'terminal' if one doesn't already exist.

That's it.

COMMANDS                                            *primary-terminal-commands*

vim-primary-terminal provides the following commands:

                                                    *:PrimaryTerminalOpen*
:PrimaryTerminalOpen        Open the primary terminal buffer in the current
                            window.

                                                    *:PrimaryTerminalOpenSplit*
:PrimaryTerminalOpenSplit   Open the primary terminal buffer in a horizontal
                            split window.

                                                    *:PrimaryTerminalOpenVsplit*
:PrimaryTerminalOpenVsplit  Open the primary terminal buffer in a vertical
                            split window.

                                                    *:PrimaryTerminalOpenDynamic*
:PrimaryTerminalOpenDynamic Open the primary terminal buffer in either a
                            horizontal or vertical split window. If the
                            current window is less than 120 columns, the
                            window will be horizontal. Otherwise, it will be
                            vertical. 120 was chosen as a rough estimate for
                            space enough for 2 side-by-side windows.

                                                    *:T*
:T {args}                   Send {args} to the primary terminal.

                                                    *:T!*
:T! {args}                  Like |:T|, but load the primary terminal buffer in
                            the preview window.

                                                    *:Tkill*
:Tkill                      Send `Ctrl-c` to the terminal.
